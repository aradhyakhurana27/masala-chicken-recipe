I like chicken masala as it is very delicious, the recipe is quite easy and it does not take much time to prepare if you have the ingredients with you.

A British Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, proprietor of the Shish Mahal restaurant in the west end of Glasgow, invented chicken  masala by improvising a sauce made from yogurt, cream, and spices.
